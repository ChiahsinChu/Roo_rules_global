# Global Git Rules

## 1. Philosophy: Momentum over Perfection

- **Commit Early, Commit Often:** Do not wait for a perfect implementation. If the "vibe" is right and the code runs, commit it.
- **WIP is Acceptable:** It is perfectly fine to commit broken code to a feature branch if it preserves a thought process or checkpoint.
- **Squash Later:** We optimize for history cleanliness _at the merge_, not during the flow.

## 2. Commit Message Conventions

_Let the AI handle the descriptions, but follow this structure:_

- **Format:** `[Type] Short summary of the vibe/change`
- **Types:**
  - `feat`: New feature or significant logic addition.
  - `vibe`: UI tweaks, styling, text changes, or "feeling" adjustments.
  - `fix`: Bug squashing.
  - `refactor`: Cleaning up messy AI-generated code.
  - `exp`: Experimental changes that might be reverted.

_Example:_ > `vibe: darken the main button shadow and increase padding`

- **Routine Checks:**
  - Use `git diff --cached` to review staged changes
  - Make brief, clear commit messages that reflect the essence of the change.
  - Avoid overly generic messages like "update" or "changes".
  - User review: Before finalizing a commit, quickly review the changes to ensure they align with the intended purpose.

## 3. Branching Strategy

- **Master is Sacred:** Never push directly to master. Master must always be deployable/runnable.
- **Feature Branches:** Create branches for every distinct "session" or idea.
  - Naming: `vibe/feature-name` or `feat/topic`.
- **Abandon Freely:** If a branch feels stuck or the AI hallucinates too much, abandon it. Create a fresh branch from `master`.

## 4. The "Undo" Button

- If a generation goes wrong, hard reset immediately rather than trying to "fix forward" extensively.
- Command: `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` is your friend.

## 5. Automation & Safety

- **Pre-commit:** Ensure a linter (standard/ruff/prettier) runs on pre-commit. The AI creates messy formatting; the linter fixes it.
- **No Secrets:** strict adherence to `.gitignore`. Never commit `.env` files, API keys, or large generated datasets.

## 6. Pull Request / Merge

- **Context is King:** When creating a PR (or asking AI to summarize), focus on _why_ the change happened, not just _what_ changed.
- **Squash & Merge:** Always squash feature branch commits into a single clean commit when merging to master.
