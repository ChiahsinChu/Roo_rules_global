# 🚦 Document Lifecycle & Governance

This document defines how project documentation in `docs/agents/` is managed. The Agent must STRICTLY respect the status of every markdown file.

## 1. The Header Block

All documentation files (docs, plans, specs) must start with this exact header block:

```markdown
---
status: draft # draft | review | published | archived
author: <name>
last_updated: <yyyy-mm-dd>
---
```

Before editing ANY documentation file, check the header block defined above.

## 2. Status Definitions & Permissions

### `status: draft`

- **Meaning:** Active work-in-progress. Brainstorming, rough notes, or initial implementations.
- **Agent Permission:** ✅ **EDIT ALLOWED.**
- You may refine, rewrite, and update logic freely.
- **Action:** specific instruction: When you edit a draft, you must update the `last_updated` date in the header.

### `status: review`

- **Meaning:** Content is complete but waiting for human sign-off.
- **Agent Permission:** ⛔ **READ-ONLY.**
- Do NOT edit the text directly.
- If changes are needed, propose them in the chat window or create a new file (e.g., `_v2`).

### `status: published`

- **Meaning:** The agreed-upon source of truth.
- **Agent Permission:** ⛔ **IMMUTABLE.**
- Never modify. Treat this as a constraint/rule for your code.
- To change this, you must ask the user to downgrade it to `draft` first.

### `status: archived`

- **Meaning:** Historical context or deprecated ideas.
- **Agent Permission:** ⛔ **IGNORE.**
- Do not use this for current context unless explicitly asked.

## 3. Auto-Formatting Rule

If a document lacks a header:

1. Assume it is `status: draft`.
2. **Action:** In your first edit, strictly prepend the Header Block to the top of the file with today's date.
